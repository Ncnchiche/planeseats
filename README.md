# planeseats
Program Description
This Program assigns seats in an airplane. There are 12 seats on the plane, 4 in first class and 8 in economy.

•  If the user types 1 then the user should be assigned a seat in first class. If the user types 2 then the user should be assigned a seat in economy.
•  If the user types 0 for a sentinel value the program should exit with a 0 return code.
•  The program should then print a line indicating the seat the person was assigned. This would be like a boarding pass.
•  The program should not assign a seat that has already been assigned. 
•  If all seats in the desired section are taken, but there are available seats in the other section, then the user should be asked if they want a seat in the other section.
•  If the user says no, tell them "The next flight will be tomorrow."
•  If there are no seats available, tell them "The next flight will be tomorrow.""
